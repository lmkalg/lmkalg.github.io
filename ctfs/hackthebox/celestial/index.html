    <h1 id="celestial">Celestial</h1>
<h2 id="user">User</h2>
<p>After the nmap output we see that there is an open port running express js: 
<img alt="nmap" src="../images/nmap.png" /></p>
<p>Next step was to run <strong>dirb</strong> against it, while I went to see this page using a web browser.</p>
<p>Once we enter with the browser, a <strong>CUSTOM</strong> page saying 404 appears.. But if you go to analyze the HTTP response, you'll see that it isn't a real 404.. In fact, doing a deeper analysis, we will see that the <strong>set-cookie</strong> is present, and the payload seems to be base64. </p>
<p><img alt="set cookie" src="../images/celestial/set_cookie.png" /></p>
<p>If we refresh the page we will see this output:</p>
<p><img alt="hey dummy" src="../images/celestial/hey_dummy.png" /></p>
<p>And if we decode the cookie, we'll have:</p>
<pre><code class="json">{&quot;username&quot;:&quot;Dummy&quot;,&quot;country&quot;:&quot;Idk Probably Somewhere Dumb&quot;,&quot;city&quot;:&quot;Lametown&quot;,&quot;num&quot;:&quot;2&quot;}
</code></pre>

<p>So my first attempt was trying to change the username for admin, or something like that but nothing happened. Then I realize that the message in the index page was saying <strong>Dummy</strong> and <strong>2</strong>.  So I changed the <strong>num</strong> for an "a" and the following I received the following response:</p>
<p><img alt="eval" src="../images/celestial/eval.png" /></p>
<p>This was great. If you pay attention to the response, you'll see that the error cames from an <strong>eval</strong> function. So basically this means that they we can execute arbitrary JS code?.. Let's see..:</p>
<p><img alt="payload_test" src="../images/celestial/payload_test.png" /></p>
<p>After a couple of tests I realize that the server was doing something like:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">...
eval(&quot;num + num&quot;);
...
</code></pre>

<p>That's why I appended "//" to the final of the payload in order to comment the rest of the line.</p>
<p>So, basically this means that we are able to execute arbitrary JS code. Next step, was look in the internet for a reverse shell. I found it (its in my documentation), adapt it and used it.</p>
<p><img alt="reverse shell" src="../images/celestial/reverse_shell.png" /></p>
<p>Once I got the reverse shell and upgraded to TTY, I finally get the user.txt from the <strong>Documents</strong> directory.</p>
<h2 id="root">Root</h2>
<p>This part was very straightforward... 
Once I get the user shell, I start seeing the files that were in the <strong>/home/user</strong> directory and there was a strange file called <strong>output.txt</strong> which was own by root, but readeable for everyone. This file just contained the message " Script is running ".</p>
<p>Afterwards, I found a python script in the <strong>Documents</strong> directory of the user, that just had the following line </p>
<pre><code class="python">print &quot;Script is running...&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>output.txt</strong> was being written each 5 minutes. So quickly I understood that this script was being executed by the <strong>root</strong> user and the output was written to this <strong>txt</strong> file. </p>
<p>So, why I did was to edit the script and add the following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="python">content = open(&quot;/root/root.txt&quot;,&quot;r&quot;).read()
print content
</code></pre>

<p>After 5 minutes (or less) the output was written again, and the content was the flag: </p>
<p><img alt="root" src="../images/celestial/root.png" />    </p>
